# 3.4 MongoDB Bug Hunt Presentation

This repo contains the presentation delivered by Ramon Fernandez at the September 7, 2016 MUG meetup in New York City. It describes the goal of the bug hunt, how to file an actionable bug, and what aspects of the MongoDB 3.4 build should be tested.

The repo contains a PDF version of the presentation for those who would like to use it as it stands. It is listed as [3.4BugHunt.pdf](https://github.com/alimgafar/3.4_MongoDB_Bug_Hunt/blob/master/3.4BugHunt.pdf).

There is also PowerPoint version available for those who would prefer to use Microsoft PowerPoint. Unlike the PDF version, it can also be customized easily by the presenter. Download it at [3.4BugHunt.pptx](https://github.com/alimgafar/3.4_MongoDB_Bug_Hunt/blob/master/3.4BugHunt.pptx).
